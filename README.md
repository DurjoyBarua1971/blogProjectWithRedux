📝 Blogging Platform – Developer Documentation
1. 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple yet functional blogging platform built using React, Redux Toolkit, and Vite. It allows users to register, sign in, create blog posts, and react to them using emoji-based feedback (✔️ / ❌). Data for users and posts is stored entirely on the client via localStorage, making it a fully client-side demo app.

It demonstrates:

Clean React patterns

Redux Toolkit usage

Component modularity

Tailwind CSS styling

Form handling with Formik

Toast notifications with SweetAlert2

This project is perfect for learning modern frontend workflows, state persistence, and UI/UX basics.

7. 🧠 Potential AI Hallucinations / Debugging Notes
Area	Issue	Suggestion
Formik Usage	AI may suggest incorrect prop names (form.errors.field)	Use errors[field] from useFormikContext()
Redux Slice Access	AI might forget useSelector((state) => state.loginInfo)	Always confirm slice name and nesting
localStorage Handling	May omit JSON parsing/stringifying	Always wrap data with JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse()
Tailwind Class Conflicts	Overlapping utility classes	Check dev tools for specificity conflicts
SweetAlert2 Toast Config	Missing mixin configs for consistency	Create a toastMixin.ts for reusable configs
